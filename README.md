# eight-queens

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle"> eight queens</a> problem is a common one in computer science courses.  Basically, the program has to find positions for eight separate queen pieces on the board such that no piece is threatening another.  My solution might not be the most efficient, but it gets the job done.
